         Even if there are no gang gangs in the area, you can still help them by donating. If there is a gang gang in the area around you, you could conduct a habitat survey, or report the location to the gang gang cockatoo project. Gang-gangâ€™s are wild birds, so it's hard to physically help them, but there are professionals who do know how to help them. If you have any concerns about gang gangs in your area, once again, search up the gang gang cockatoo project. You can also help out by planting eucalyptus, wattles and indtroduced hawthorns.
