    <div class="text-center d-flex p-2 col-sm align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <p>The Gang-gang Cockatoo is found throughout many parts of south-eastern Australia. In the summer, they are mostly found at higher elevations, where they breed in tree hollows in the moist eucalyptus forests of the mountains of the Great Dividing Range. It is also found in and woodlands, with a dense understory of shrubs. After breeding has finished, and the days grow colder, they leave the mountains and fly to lower areas to spend the autumn and winter. There they are common in suburban gardens of lowland towns and cities. 
In winter, Gang-gangs move to lower altitudes into drier, more open forests and woodlands. At this time, they may be seen on roadsides and in parks and gardens of urban areas. They require tall trees for nest hollows. </p>

    <h1 class="text-center">Feeding</h1>
    
    <div class="text-center d-flex p-2 col-sm align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <p>Gang-gang Cockatoos feed mostly on seeds of native and introduced trees and shrubs. They have a preference for the seeds of eucalypts (gumtrees), wattles (acacias) and some non-native plants including hawthorns. They will also eat berries, fruits, nuts and insects and their larvae. They are mainly arboreal (found in trees), coming to the ground only to drink and forage among fallen fruits, seeds or pinecones. Gang-gangs feed in flocks of up to 60 birds outside the breeding season; they feed in pairs or small family groups during the breeding season. </p>

    <h1 class="text-center">Breeding</h1>
    
    <div class="text-center d-flex p-2 col-sm align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <p>Gang-gang Cockatoos form close, monogamous pairs. They nest from October to January. The female chooses a nest hollow in a suitable tree and both birds prepare the nest for egg-laying, lining it with wood chips and dust by chewing at the sides of the hollow. The female lays 1-3 eggs, but usually lays 2. Both birds incubate the eggs for about 30 days and care for the young for about 56 days. Parents feed their young for a further four to six weeks after fledging and family groups will be seen feeding together during the breeding season. In some cases, 'cr√®ches' will be formed - where several pairs nest close together, their young will roost together in the same tree while their parents are foraging.</p>
